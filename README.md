# documentation

This would be a big one, we would need the whole town to pitch in.

## [Goals](GOALS.md)

## [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

documentation is an OPEN Open Source Project. This means that:

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given
commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This
project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.
