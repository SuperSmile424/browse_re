This would be a big one, we would need the whole town to pitch in.

The mission is to create a **documentation generation system** that's
_beautiful_ by default, _flexible_ across formats and styles, and
_powerful_ enough to support JSDoc's advanced syntax.

_We also have a list of specific [goals](GOALS.md), and plenty of
[issues](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/issues) that we'd
love help with._

documentation is an OPEN Open Source Project. This means that:

commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This
project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.
